## Bench Press:
**Sets:** 3<br>
**Reps:** 5<br>
**Current Weight:** 30kg<br>

**Focus:** overall chest.<br>

## Incline Dumbbell Press:
**Sets:** 3<br>

## Standing High to Low Cable Chest Fly:
**Sets:** 3<br>
**Reps:** 20<br>
**Form:** Stand with a slight forward lean, arms extended but slightly bent, and bring the cables together in a wide arc, squeezing your chest at the peak contraction. Return to the starting position with control.<br>
**Focus:** Chest isolation for endurance and hypertrophy.<br>
