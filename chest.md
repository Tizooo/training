**Bench Press:**<br>
Sets: 3
Reps: 5
Form: Keep your feet flat on the ground, arch your lower back slightly, and ensure the bar touches your chest at the bottom of the movement. Maintain control throughout the lift.
Focus: overall chest.

**Incline Dumbbell Press:**
Sets: 3
Reps: 8
Form: Lower the dumbbells to chest level with elbows at a 90-degree angle, and press them up until your arms are fully extended. Ensure a full range of motion.
Incline: 20–30° is perfect for targeting the upper chest without putting too much strain on the shoulders.
Note: Using dumbbells can provide a greater range of motion and better muscle activation compared to a barbell.
Focus: upper chest.

**Bar Dips:**
Sets: 3
Reps: 12
Form: Lean forward to engage the chest muscles more effectively. Keep your elbows slightly flared and lower yourself until your upper arms are parallel to the ground before pushing back up.
Focus: Lower chest.

**Standing Cable Chest Fly:**
Sets: 3
Reps: 20
Form: Stand with a slight forward lean, arms extended but slightly bent, and bring the cables together in a wide arc, squeezing your chest at the peak contraction. Return to the starting position with control.
Focus: Chest isolation for endurance and hypertrophy.
